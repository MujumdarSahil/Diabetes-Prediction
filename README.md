# Diabetes-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health metrics and lifestyle factors. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., and builds a predictive model.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MujumdarSahil/diabetes-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd diabetes-prediction

Usage
Open and run the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell sequentially.
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by providing relevant input features.
